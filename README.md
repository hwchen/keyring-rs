A cross-platform library to manage storage and retrieval of passwords (and other secrets) in the underlying platform secure store, with a fully-developed example that provides a command-line interface.

## Usage

To use this crate in your project, you must include it in your `Cargo.toml` and specify a feature for each supported credential store you want to use. For example, if you want to use the platform credential stores on Mac and Win, and use the Secret Service (synchronously) on Linux and \*nix platforms, you would add a snippet such as this to your `[dependencies]` section:

```toml
keyring = { version = "3", features = ["apple-native", "windows-native", "sync-secret-service"] }
```

This will give you access to the `keyring` crate in your code. Now you can use the `Entry::new` function to create a new keyring entry. The `new` function takes a service name and a user's name which together identify the entry.

Passwords (strings) or secrets (binary data) can be added to an entry using its `set_password` or `set_secret` methods, respectively. (These methods create an entry in the underlying credential store.) The password or secret can then be read back using the `get_password` or `get_secret` methods. The underlying credential (with its password/secret data) can then be removed using the `delete_credential` method.

```rust
use keyring::{Entry, Result};

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let entry = Entry::new("my-service", "my-name")?;
    entry.set_password("topS3cr3tP4$$w0rd")?;
    let password = entry.get_password()?;
    println!("My password is '{}'", password);
    entry.delete_credential()?;
    Ok(())
}
```

## Errors

Creating and operating on entries can yield a `keyring::Error` which provides both a platform-independent code that classifies the error and, where relevant, underlying platform errors or more information about what went wrong.

## Examples

The keychain-rs project contains a sample application (`keyring-cli`) and a sample library (`ios`).

The `keyring-cli` application is a command-line interface to the full functionality of the keyring. Invoke it without arguments to see usage information. It handles binary data input and output using base64 encoding. It can be installed using `cargo install` and used to experiment with library functionality. It can also be used when debugging keyring-based applications to probe the contents of the credential store; just be sure to build it using the same features/credential stores that are used by your application.

The `ios` library is a full exercise of all the iOS functionality; it's meant to be loaded into an iOS test harness such as the one found in [this project](https://github.com/brotskydotcom/rust-on-ios). While the library can be compiled and linked to on macOS as well, doing so doesn't provide any advantages over using the crate directly.

## Client Testing

This crate comes with a mock credential store that can be used by clients who want to test without accessing the native platform store. The mock store is cross-platform and allows mocking errors as well as successes.

## Extensibility

This crate allows clients to "bring their own credential store" by providing traits that clients can implement. See the [developer docs](https://docs.rs/keyring/) for details.

## Platforms

This crate provides built-in implementations of the following platform-specific credential stores:

* _Linux_: The DBus-based Secret Service and the kernel keyutils.
* _FreeBSD_, _OpenBSD_: The DBus-based Secret Service.
* _macOS_, _iOS_: The local keychain.
* _Windows_: The Windows Credential Manager.

To enable the stores you want, you use features: there is one feature for each possibly-included credential store. If you specify a feature (e.g., `dbus-secret-service`) _and_ your target platform (e.g., `freebsd`) supports that credential store, it will be included as the default credential store in that build. That way you can have a build command that specifies a single credential store for each of your target platforms, and use that same build command for all targets.

If you don't enable any credential stores that are supported on a specific target, the _mock_ keystore will be the default on that target. If you enable multiple credential stores for a specific target, you will get a compile error. See the [developer docs](https://docs.rs/keyring/) for details of which features control the inclusion of which credential stores (and which platforms each credential store targets).

Please note: Since neither the maintainers nor GitHub do testing on BSD variants, we rely on contributors to support these platforms. Thanks for your help!

## Upgrading from v2

The major functional change between v2 and v3 is the addition of synchronous support for the Secret Service via the [dbus-secret-service crate](https://crates.io/crates/dbus-secret-service). This means that keyring users of the Secret Service no longer need to link with an async runtime.

The main API change between v2 and v3 is the addition of support for non-string (i.e., binary) "password" data. To accommodate this, two changes have been made:

1. There are two new methods on `Entry` objects: `set_secret` and `get_secret`. These are the analogs of `set_password` and `get_password`, but instead of taking or returning strings they take or return binary data (byte arrays/vectors).

2. The v2 method `delete_password` has been renamed `delete_credential`, both to clarify what's actually being deleted and to emphasize that it doesn't matter whether it's holding a "password" or a "secret".

Another API change between v2 and v3 is that the notion of a default feature set has gone away: you must now specify explicitly which crate-supported keystores you want included (other than the `mock` keystore, which is always present). So all keyring client developers will need to update their `Cargo.toml` file to use the new features correctly.

All v2 data is fully forward-compatible with v3 data; there have been no changes at all in that respect.

The MSRV has been moved to 1.75, and all direct dependencies are at their latest stable versions.
