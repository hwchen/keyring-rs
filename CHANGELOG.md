## Version 0.6.1
- bug fix for special characters on osx.

## Version 0.6.0
- fix behavior in windows where third-party editing of password would result in malformed retrieved password. The solution was to convert all strings to and from Windows utf16, where before I was passing the secret as a blob from utf8.
- remove dependency on rustcserialize, use hex.
- update rpassword to 2.0, removing dependency on termios
- fix some mistakes in syntax for targeting dependencies to an os.

## Version 0.5.1
- remove some unwraps which were causing a problem in linux

## Version 0.5
- bumped secret-service to 0.4.0, which improved error-handling around emptyr passwords a bit more (in 0.3.1), and made gmp dependency optional in 0.4.0

## Version 0.4
- yanked. But originally was trying to handle secret-service empty password better. But there was an error in secret-service 0.3

## Version 0.3
- Windows support!

## Version 0.2

- Fix major bug in decoding output on osx. Now handles both regular and "special" (non-ascii) utf8 chars appropriately.
- add simple tests for the fix!
- add changelog.

## Version 0.1

- linux implementation using secret-service backend.
- osx implementation using security cli.
