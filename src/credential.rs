# Platorm-independent secure storage model

This module defines a plug and play model for platform-specific credential stores.
The model comprises two traits: [CredentialBuilderApi] for the underlying store
and [CredentialApi] for the entries in the store.  These traits must be implemented
in a thread-safe way, a requirement captured in the [CredentialBuilder] and
[CredentialApi] types that wrap them.
